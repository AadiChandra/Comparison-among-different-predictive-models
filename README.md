# Comparison-among-different-predictive-models
This can easily explain the concept of matrices and comparison between different predictive models 
in this, I have tried to clear the concept of using various modeling techniques, here I have used 4 models to demonstrate my insights which are
->Linear Regression
->Decision Tree
->Random Forest
->Gradient Boosting
After initializing the models and calculating the evaluation metrics, MAE(Mean Absolute Error) & R², I got the insight that mae value of Linear regression is the least among all and greatest for R² making it the best-performing model among these 4. It means Linear regression is best for this dataset
